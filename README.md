# 🚀 NearFuel

**NearFuel** is a decentralized **gas sponsorship protocol** built on the [NEAR](https://near.org/) blockchain. It allows users to interact with dApps and perform transactions **without paying gas fees**. Instead, other users—called **Sponsors**—cover the costs and earn rewards in return.

The goal of NearFuel is to **make Web3 user-friendly** by removing the friction of gas fees, while creating new incentives for power users, investors, and contributors.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Users** interact with supported dApps without needing to hold or spend NEAR for gas.
2. **Sponsors** deposit NEAR into the protocol to pay gas fees on behalf of users.
3. Sponsors are rewarded through:
   - 🗳 **Governance Power** via the NearFuel DAO
   - 💸 **Revenue Share** from sponsored activity
   - 🧠 **Ad-Supported Sponsorships** (optional)
   - ⚡ **Short-Term Gas Loans** (future feature)

## 🧩 Key Features

- 💨 **Gasless UX** for users: no NEAR needed to use dApps
- 🏦 **Sponsor System**: anyone can fund gas and earn rewards
- 🛠 **DAO Governance**: sponsors vote on supported dApps and policies
- 📈 **Activity-Based Rewards**: earn more as more users transact
- 🎯 **Ad-Based Coverage**: sponsors can earn from user opt-in ads
- 🔐 **Secure & Transparent**: built fully onchain on NEAR
